/*
 * Exercise: Exceptions
 *
 * 1. Create an exception named `OddNumberError'.  This exception
 *    should support the same prototype functions as the Error
 *    exception.
 *
 * 2. Write a function called `check'.  The check function should
 *    accept a single argument.
 *
 *    If the argument to the check function is even, return true.  If
 *    it is odd, throw an OddNumberError exception.
